            Sai Siva Kumar is a doctoral student in Oyler’s research group and
            serves as a graduate teaching assistant for physical chemistry
            laboratory course at Department of Chemistry, UMKC. He also serves
            at the capacity of international student ambassador at international
            student affairs office (ISAO), UMKC. He received his bachelor’s
            (2014) and master’s degrees (2016) in chemistry from Sri Sathya Sai
            Institute of Higher Learning, India. Alongside his doctoral program,
            he has enrolled in ‘preparing future faculty’ program since 2018.
            His research areas of interest include material synthesis, thin-film
            deposition, solid-state NMR and other spectroscopies. To his credit,
            he taught several undergraduate laboratory courses, published over
            five research papers and deliver talks at several symposia. He
            believes in student-centered and experiential learning; and hopes to
            integrate research in teaching methodology.
