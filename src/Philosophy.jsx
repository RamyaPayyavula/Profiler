          <article>
            My teaching philosophy is sprouted from my educational experience
            and my notion of an ideal mentor. I consider teaching is an art of
            motivating young minds and nurturing their latent talent. Teaching
            is a process of unlearning and relearning the subject along with
            students and not just passing information. Each student is unique in
            their learning curve â€“ they require support at different levels.{" "}

          <article>
            I am a first-generation student, born and brought up in a culturally
            and socio-economically diverse society. I pursued my doctoral
            program at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), far from my
            home, where I explored and experienced diverse cultures from global
            student population. I served as an international student ambassador
            at UMKC for three years, during which, I came to know about
            different ideologies and cultures while interacting with
            international and domestic students. I strongly believe that a
            diverse academic campus is beneficial place for students to learn
            new perspectives and become open-minded in this continuously
            globalizing world.{" "}
